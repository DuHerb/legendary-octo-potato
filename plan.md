## Current Session Goals

### Session 3 (Current)
**Focus**: Storybook and UI Component Development

#### 3.1 Worktree Access Issue ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS RESOLUTION**
- Issue: Claude Code security constraints prevent `cd` to `../worktrees/` directory
- Current Limitation: Cannot access worktrees created outside working directory
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  1. Create worktrees within project subdirectory (`./worktrees/`)
  2. Use regular branch workflow instead of git worktrees
  3. Modify Claude Code container permissions (requires user intervention)
- **Current Approach**: Using regular branch workflow for issue development

#### 3.2 Storybook Implementation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Implement Storybook with generic Button component
  - Issue: #5 (Closed)
  - Pull Request: #6 (Ready for review)
  - Branch: storybook-button-implementation

**Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Storybook 8.x with React + Vite framework setup
- ‚úÖ Button component with 5 variants, 4 sizes, accessibility features
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive stories with interactive playground
- ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ‚úÖ Package integration tested in web application
- ‚úÖ Development workflow established for future components
### Session 4 (Next)
**Focus**: Phase 2 Database Layer Implementation
- [ ] Set up Drizzle ORM configuration
  - Issue: TBD (use `/pushIssue Phase 2` to create)
  - Branch: TBD
  - Status: Ready to start
- [ ] Implement complete database schema
- [ ] Create DAO pattern architecture
- [ ] Add migration system
- [ ] Set up database testing framework

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces for shared dependencies and atomic changes
- **Backend Framework**: Fastify for TypeScript-first development and performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type safety
- **Data Access**: DAO pattern for database abstraction and testability
- **Frontend Stack**: Complete TanStack ecosystem for modern React development

### Domain Model Decisions
- **Cascading Algorithm**: Two-phase processing (calculation + application)
- **Filter System**: Flat value or percentage-based bucket filters
- **Hold Amount**: Minimum guarantee system with floor logic
- **State Management**: Automatic bucket state transitions
- **Money Bucket**: Overflow collection with redistribution capabilities

### DevEx Workflow Decisions (Session 2)
- **GitHub CLI Integration**: Standardized Claude Code attribution for all issues/PRs
- **Git Worktree Isolation**: Dedicated workspaces per issue in ../worktrees/ directory
- **Slash Command System**: Comprehensive agent command set for workflow automation
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Project-specific `/prime` initialization for context consistency
- **Code Review Standards**: Specialized review agents with zero-tolerance enforcement
- **Progress Tracking**: Mandatory plan.md updates with issue/worktree/branch references

### UI Component Decisions (Session 3)
- **Storybook Framework**: Storybook 8.x with React + Vite for component development
- **Component Architecture**: TypeScript-first with comprehensive prop interfaces
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with ARIA labels and focus management
- **Design System**: Tailwind CSS with custom color palette and utility-first approach
- **Development Workflow**: Interactive stories with controls, documentation, and playground
- **Package Structure**: Modular exports with proper TypeScript declarations

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Merge Storybook PR**: Review and merge PR #6 to integrate UI component library
2. **Phase 2 Database Layer**: Use `/pushIssue Phase 2` to create comprehensive database implementation issue
3. **Migration System**: Set up Drizzle ORM, database migrations, and seeding
4. **DAO Pattern Implementation**: Create comprehensive data access layer following established patterns
5. **Testing Framework**: Create database testing utilities with test containers
6. **Business Logic Foundation**: Begin cascade algorithm implementation after database layer

## Notes for Future Sessions

- **ALWAYS run `/prime` at the start of new Claude Code sessions**
- Use `/pushIssue`, `/pullIssue`, `/closeIssue` workflow for all development tasks
- Update plan.md with issue/worktree/branch references for every task
- Maintain strict TypeScript configuration throughout
- Ensure DAO pattern is never bypassed (use `/review` to enforce)
- Test cascade algorithm thoroughly with edge cases
- Keep frontend and backend types synchronized
- Document architectural decisions as they're made
- Preserve living documentation (CLAUDE.md files) across all workspaces

- [ ] Sub-100ms API response times
- [ ] Zero runtime type errors
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- [x] Effective Claude Code multi-agent workflows
