## Current Session Goals

### Session 1 (Current)
- [x] Organize technical specifications
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [ ] Set up basic monorepo structure
- [ ] Initialize first workspace packages

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces for shared dependencies and atomic changes
- **Backend Framework**: Fastify for TypeScript-first development and performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type safety
- **Data Access**: DAO pattern for database abstraction and testability
- **Frontend Stack**: Complete TanStack ecosystem for modern React development

### Domain Model Decisions
- **Cascading Algorithm**: Two-phase processing (calculation + application)
- **Filter System**: Flat value or percentage-based bucket filters
- **Hold Amount**: Minimum guarantee system with floor logic
- **State Management**: Automatic bucket state transitions
- **Money Bucket**: Overflow collection with redistribution capabilities

## Next Steps

1. **Complete current session**: Finish monorepo setup and basic project structure
2. **Phase 1 Focus**: Establish solid foundation with proper tooling and environment
3. **Database Priority**: Implement schema and DAO pattern early for strong data layer
4. **Iterative Development**: Build features incrementally with testing at each step

## Notes for Future Sessions

- Maintain strict TypeScript configuration throughout
- Ensure DAO pattern is never bypassed
- Test cascade algorithm thoroughly with edge cases
- Keep frontend and backend types synchronized
- Document architectural decisions as they're made
- Preserve living documentation (CLAUDE.md files) across all workspaces

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- [ ] Sub-100ms API response times
- [ ] Zero runtime type errors
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Effective Claude Code multi-agent workflows
- [ ] Clean, maintainable codebase structure
