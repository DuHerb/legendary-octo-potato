# Issue #7: Phase 2: Database Layer Implementation

**Status**: In Progress | **Branch**: issue-7-phase-2-database-layer-implementation | **Created**: 2025-07-08

## Issue Summary

Implementation of the complete database layer for the envelope budgeting application, including Drizzle ORM configuration, DAO pattern implementation, and comprehensive testing infrastructure.

## Technical Specifications Required

- **Database Schema**: `.claude/specs/database-schema.md` - Complete PostgreSQL schema with relationships, indexes, and constraints
- **Backend Architecture**: `.claude/specs/backend-spec.md` - DAO pattern implementation with Fastify integration  
- **Domain Model**: `.claude/specs/domain-model.md` - Business logic interfaces and service layer requirements
- **Architecture Overview**: `.claude/specs/architecture.md` - Monorepo structure and technical stack decisions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase Information
**Phase 2: Database Layer** - Ready to Start (2-3 sessions estimated)

This is the foundational database implementation that will support the cascading bucket algorithm and all core business operations.

### Task Breakdown

#### 2.1 Database Schema
- [ ] Set up Drizzle ORM configuration
- [ ] Create database schema files
- [ ] Implement migration system
- [ ] Add database indexes and constraints

#### 2.2 DAO Pattern Implementation
- [ ] Create base DAO interfaces
- [ ] Implement PostgreSQL DAOs
- [ ] Create mock DAOs for testing
- [ ] Add DAO dependency injection

#### 2.3 Database Testing
- [ ] Set up test database with Docker
- [ ] Create database test utilities
- [ ] Write DAO integration tests
- [ ] Test migration and rollback procedures

### Dependencies
- ✅ Phase 1 Foundation completed - Monorepo structure established
- ✅ PostgreSQL Container available - Docker Compose configuration ready
- ✅ Shared Types available - Core domain types defined in shared package

## Development Guidelines

### Critical Requirements
- **DAO Pattern (CRITICAL)**: All database operations MUST go through DAO layer
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Required across all packages with explicit return types
- **Monorepo Structure**: Create new `packages/database` workspace
- **Database Abstraction**: Never import database schema directly in business logic
- **Testing**: Use test containers for database integration tests

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Drizzle ORM configuration completed and functional
- [ ] Complete database schema implemented with all entities
- [ ] Migration system operational with rollback capabilities
- [ ] Base DAO interfaces defined for all domain entities
- [ ] PostgreSQL DAO implementations for all entities
- [ ] Mock DAO implementations for testing
- [ ] Database indexes and constraints properly configured
- [ ] Test database setup with Docker integration
- [ ] Comprehensive DAO integration tests
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors in strict mode
- [ ] All code follows established project patterns
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect database layer

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Issue setup and branch creation
- [ ] [Tasks will be updated as work progresses]

### Current Focus
Set up Drizzle ORM configuration in new packages/database workspace

### Blockers
None currently identified

## Technical Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations with PostgreSQL
- Implementing DAO pattern for database abstraction and testability
- Creating separate packages/database workspace for clean separation

### Code Patterns Used
- DAO pattern for all database operations
- Dependency injection for DAO instances
- Mock implementations for testing
- Comprehensive migration system

### Testing Approach
- Test containers for database integration testing
- Mock DAOs for unit testing business logic
- Comprehensive DAO test suites
- Migration and rollback testing

### Cascading Bucket Algorithm Requirements
The database layer must support:
- Bucket filter configurations (flat_value/percentage)
- Hold amount floor logic
- Atomic transaction processing for cascade operations
- Money bucket overflow collection and redistribution
- Bucket state management (active/full/locked)
